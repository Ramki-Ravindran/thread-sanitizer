#summary Useful flags.

Flags are passed via TSAN_OPTIONS environment variable.

  * force_seq_cst_atomics
This flag turns all atomic operations into sequentially consistent operations. This is useful to check whether a race is caused by incorrect memory ordering or not.
<code>
$ TSAN_OPTIONS="force_seq_cst_atomics=1" ./my_program
</code>

  * If you consistently see only one stack trace in reports, you may try increasing "history size". That can be done only during compilation, pass -DTSAN_HISTORY_SIZE=X to the compiler. Default value for X is 128, you may try increasing it to e.g. 256, 512, 1024, etc.
