#summary Runtime flags.

Runtime flags are passed via TSAN_OPTIONS environment variable, separate flags are separated with spaces, e.g.:
{{{
$ TSAN_OPTIONS="history_size=7 force_seq_cst_atomics=1" ./myprogram
}}}

|| Flag name || Default value || Description ||
|| force_seq_cst_atomics || 0 || This flag turns all atomic operations into sequentially consistent operations. This is useful to check whether a race is caused by incorrect memory ordering or not. ||
|| history size || 2 || If you consistently see only one stack trace in reports, you may try increasing "history size". That can be done only during compilation, pass -DTSAN_HISTORY_SIZE=X to the compiler. Default value for X is 128, you may try increasing it to e.g. 256, 512, 1024, etc. ||
